# Roll the Dice Project 🎲

Welcome to the **Roll the Dice** project! 🎲 This is my second game, where I've used **DOM manipulation** and **fundamentals of events**. The game allows two players to participate in a thrilling dice-rolling challenge.

## Game Rules 🌟

1. **Player 1** starts by rolling the dice. Click the "Roll" button to unleash the randomness!
2. The dice will reveal a number between 1 and 6. If you're feeling lucky, roll again or choose to **hold** your current score.
3. **Player 2** then takes their turn, following the same steps.
4. The winning score is  100
